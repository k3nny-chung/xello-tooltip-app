# Xello Tooltip 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5.

A reusable tooltip component as per requirements:
```
Create a single page Angular 4+ app with simple routing that has one state/view. In it, place two buttons that when clicked, show a tooltip above the button with some text in it.
When button A is clicked, if button Bâ€™s tooltip is open it should close and vice versa - only one tooltip should be visible at a time. Either tooltip should close when clicked anywhere outside of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip should close when ESC key is pressed.

Bonus:
If you scroll down to an open tooltip it should detect being at the edge of the screen and change position to be below the button
```

## To Run

After cloning this repo and running `npm install` on the project directory, run `npm start` to run the app.
